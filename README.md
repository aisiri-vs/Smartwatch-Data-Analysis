# Smartwatch Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes smartwatch data to gain insights into user activity patterns and health metrics. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, we explore a dataset containing information such as step counts, calories burned, and heart rate measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains smartwatch data including:
- Date and time
- Step count
- Calories burned
- Heart rate
- Distance covered

Note: This project uses a sample dataset. For privacy reasons, real user data is not included in this repository.
